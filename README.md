## Welcome JoRoV11 - Data and Theory

This website contains information about my empirical and theoretical research on economics and medicine. If you would like to download my lectures, handouts, podcasts, videos, and opinions, please check my personal website <a href="http://www.jorgerojas.cl" target="_blank">here</a>

In this website you will find pieces of codes to perform statistical analysis and numerical simulations. Numerical simulations can be used for econometric or macroeconomic exercises. 

For Econometrics, I usully use <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="https://rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio</a> that is a great IDE for R+Python. I also provide some chuncks of code for <a href="https://www.stata.com/" target="_blank">Stata</a> that my students usually find helpful. Of course, <a href="https://www.statalist.org/" target="_blank">Stata List</a> and <a href="https://www.stata-journal.com/" target="_blank">Stata Journal</a> are the awesome places to check out.

For Macroeconomics, I usually use <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/" target="_blank">Mathematica</a> and <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html" target="_blank">MATLAB</a>.

A great source of help and debate is <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#" target="_blank">Stack Exchange</a>. In that website, you can get free access to literally thousands of forums about different softwares and topics within each software.

Last but not least, <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a> is the right way to write.

# Header 1
This short paper focuses on the role of mathematical models to analyze the impact of pandemics on health resources and the different trade-offs that may be included in them. There is a large body of literature suggesting that mathematical modeling may be helpful to estimate how much additional equipment and infrastructure are necessary to mitigate an increase in demand for health services during a large-scale outbreak of an infectious disease. I comment on the crucial role of these models with a special focus on their strengths and limitations.
